- fix policy iteration with Q values in maze
- optimize deck init - if there is time
    * initialize the deck once, create a "pointer"
    * everytime a card is drawn from the deck, move the pointer
    * once the pointer is at the end of the deck just reshuffle and reset the pointer
    * kind of obvious, but I'm on a clock here so I had to compromise
