# TODO
- fix policy iteration with Q values in maze
    * I can't figure it out for the love of me
- put the :type thingy in function declarations
    * only do it for the big functions, 
        if there are declarations inside it isn't necessary
- The Q learning and sarsa function make multiple infractions :hankey:
    * the declarations are longer than 80 characters
    * 4 levels of indentation
    * I will have to rewrite them as classes
- write my own cart-pole model
    * import time, get a "contious model"?
