# blackjack rules reference

## general rules of the game
the goal of blackjack is to create a sum that is closer to 21 the dealer's, 
WITHOUT GOING OVER.

if you do go over, you achieve something called a bust, and lose on the spot.

the way the sum is created is by choosing to hit (taking a card),
stand or hold (stop taking cards).

numbered cards are counted towards 21 with face value, monkeys (cards with pictures)
are counted as 10.

the ace can be counted as a 1 or an 11, hands with an ace are reffered to as "soft" hands.
(hands without an ace are called "hard" hands)

at the start of the game each party gets dealt 2 cards.

cards dealt to the player are visible to all parties at all times,
while the dealer's first card is visible to everyone, his second hand
will be hidden to the player, but known to the dealer.

when the player busts or stands, the dealer reveals his second card, at which point
the dealer chooses to hit or stand on a pre-fixed policy.

if both the player and dealer stand on the same number, the game is a tie. 

## dealer's policy

the dealer will hit until his total is greater than 16.

if the dealer's first 2 cards form a soft 17, he will hit,
and won't hit if they form a hard 17.

the dealer always count an ace as 11, never as a 1

## nuances

It is possible to be dealt a "natural blackjack", meaning that the first 2 cards
form a sum of 21. The party dealt a natural blackjack wins on the spot, unless 
the other party also got dealt a natural 21.
